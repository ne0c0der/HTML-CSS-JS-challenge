# TemporalAI Frontend Challenge â€” Hero Section

Welcome to the early builder track ðŸ‘‹  
Your first task is to rebuild a **Hero Section** using only HTML + CSS.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
- Recreate a clean, centered layout
- Include a heading, paragraph, and call-to-action button
- Make it responsive (looks good on mobile + desktop)
- Focus on spacing, alignment, and simplicity

---

## ðŸ§© Steps
1. Fork this repo or clone it locally.
2. Build your section inside `index.html`.
3. Push your work and share your repo link with your mentor for review.
4. Youâ€™ll receive feedback and your next challenge after review.

## ðŸ§  Tip
Keep your CSS clean and well-commented.  
Itâ€™s not about complexity â€” itâ€™s about **clarity and structure**.

**Next Stage:**  
Once you complete this, weâ€™ll move you to a React + Tailwind challenge ðŸš€
